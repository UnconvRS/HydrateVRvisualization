# HydrateVRvisualization
This repository provides data and instructions to facilitate visualization of gas hydrate structures on Meta Quest VR headsets.

To visualize the provided gas hydrate systems, do the following:
1. Install "ChimeraX" on a WiFi-enabled desktop or laptop.
2. Install "LookSee" Molecular Viewer on the VR headset. 
3. Download the “.gro” files from the "gro" folder in this repository and import them into ChimeraX.
4. In the top menu of ChimeraX, select "Tools > General > Send to Quest".
5. In the bottom-right section of the ChimeraX app, select the "Options" button, then enter the VR headset's IP address, which is available in the "LookSee" app on the VR headset.
6. Type in a name for the file you are transferring (eg. "Hydrate1") in the text box on the left of the "Options" button.
7. Click on the "Send to Quest" button at the bottom right of ChimeraX and a ".glb" file will be transferred to the "LookSee" app on the VR headset.
8. Navigate to the "Model" section of the "LookSee" app and select the name of the transferred file (eg, "Hydrate1"), and you will see the hydrate structure in the Virtual Reality or Mixed Reality mode, depending on whether you select the pass-through mode or not on the VR settings.

We will share a link to a video tutorial that walks through this process shortly.
